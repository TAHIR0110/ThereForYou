# Prediction of epidemic disease dynamics using Machine learning model

Given an area where an epidemic outbreak has occurred, our ML model should be able to identify next outbreak prone areas and identify features which contribute significantly in the spread of the outbreak. Our approach will also take into consideration the geography, climate and population distribution of an affected area, as these are relevant features and subtly contribute to epidemic disease dynamics. Our model would be beneficial for the healthcare authorities by assisting them take the appropriate action in terms of assuring that sufficient resources are available to suffice the need and, if possible, curbing the occurrence of such epidemic disease. case study: Nipah virus spread 2018, Zika virus spread 2015-2016
