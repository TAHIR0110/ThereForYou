    "# Content Based Recommendation Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "A recommendation system (or recommender system) is a class of machine learning that uses data to help predict, narrow down, and find what people are looking for among an exponentially growing number of options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation systems are divided into three:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "* Content Based RS\n",
    "* Hybrid Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we are going to discuss Content Based RS.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Content Based Recommendation Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "* Content-based filtering methods are based on a description of the item and a profile of the user's preferences. These methods are best suited to situations where there is known data on an item (name, location, description, etc.), but not on the user. Content-based recommenders treat recommendation as a user-specific classification problem and learn a classifier for the user's likes and dislikes based on an item's features.\n",
    "* It is used to models such as TF_IDF and Word2Vec in order to capture similarity.\n",
    "* It is very powerful that a item adding newly is recommend.  \n",
    "* A key issue with content-based filtering is whether the system can learn user preferences from users' actions regarding one content source and use them across other content types. When the system is limited to recommending content of the same type as the user is already using, the value from the recommendation system is significantly less than when other content types from other services can be recommended.\n",
    "* To overcome this, most content-based recommender systems now use some form of the hybrid system.\n",
    "* Content-based recommender systems can also include opinion-based recommender systems. "

    "## What is TF-IDF?\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF stands for Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency of records. It can be defined as the calculation of how relevant a word in a series or corpus is to a text. The meaning increases proportionally to the number of times in the text a word appears but is compensated by the word frequency in the corpus (data-set).\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF is a weight factor which a word display important into document and had been calculated with statistics method. TF-IDF method use to a lot domains (sentiment analysis, RS, stop words filterin etc.) This method is divided into two. Fistly we will analyze Term Frequency(TF).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Term Frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "In document d, the frequency represents the number of instances of a given word t. Therefore, we can see that it becomes more relevant when a word appears in the text, which is rational. Since the ordering of terms is not significant, we can use a vector to describe the text in the bag of term models. For each specific term in the paper, there is an entry with the value being the term frequency.\n",
    "The weight of a term that occurs in a document is simply proportional to the term frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inverse Document Frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "Mainly, it tests how relevant the word is. The key aim of the search is to locate the appropriate records that fit the demand. Since tf considers all terms equally significant, it is therefore not only possible to use the term frequencies to measure the weight of the term in the paper. First, find the document frequency of a term t by counting the number of documents containing the term:\n",
    "\n",
    "**TF-IDF method used as multipy TF value and IDF value. (TF * IDF)**\n",
    "\n",
    "I have applied this method in my model. And I have found the similarity in between with cosine distance."
