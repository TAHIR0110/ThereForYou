## üßæ Description

This project involves the comparative analysis of three Keras image detection models, namely **VGG16** , **ResNet50** and **Xception**  applied to a specific dataset. The dataset consists of annotated images related to a particular domain, and the objectives include training and evaluating these models to compare their accuracy scores and performance metrics. Additionally, exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are employed to understand the dataset's characteristics, explore class distributions, detect imbalances, and identify areas for potential improvement. The methodology encompasses data preparation, model training, evaluation, comparative analysis of accuracy and performance metrics, and visualization of EDA insights. 

## üßÆ What I had done!

### 1. Data Loading and Preparation:
    Loaded the dataset containing image paths and corresponding labels into a pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    Bar Chart for Label Distribution: Created a bar chart to visualize the frequency distribution of different labels in the dataset.

    Pie Chart for Label Distribution: Generated a pie chart to represent the proportion of each label in the dataset.

### 3. Data Analysis:
    Counted the number of unique image paths to ensure data uniqueness and quality.
        Analyzed the distribution of image paths by label for the top 20 most frequent paths.
        Displayed the number of unique values for each categorical column to understand data variety.
        Visualized missing values in the dataset using a heatmap to identify and address potential data quality issues.
        Summarized and printed the counts of each label.

### 4.Cross-Tabulation:
    Created a cross-tabulation table to explore the relationship between image paths and labels.
       Plotted a heatmap to visualize the relationship between image paths and labels.

### 5. Image Preprocessing and Model Training:
    Loaded and preprocessed the test images, ensuring normalization of pixel values for consistency.
        Iterated through multiple models (VGG16, ResNet50 , Xception) saved in a directory and made predictions on the test dataset.
        Saved the predictions to CSV files for further analysis and comparison.

### 6. Model Prediction Visualization:
    Loaded models and visualized their predictions on a sample set of test images to qualitatively assess model performance.
        Adjusted image preprocessing for models requiring specific input sizes (e.g., 299x299 for Xception).

## üöÄ Models Implemented

Trained the dataset on various models , each of their summary is as follows :-

### Xception

When implementing the Xception model in code, we leverage its sophisticated architecture to bolster our image classification tasks. By loading the pre-trained Xception model with weights from the ImageNet dataset, we harness its comprehensive knowledge.

**Reasons for choosing Xception:** :  Lightweight (88 MB) , 
**Excellent Accuracy** (Xception achieves high accuracy in image classification tasks .) , 
Reduced Parameters (22.9M) ,
Faster Inference Speed (CPU - 39.4, GPU - 5.2)

### VGG16
I will utilize the VGG16 (Visual Geometry Group) architecture, which have deeper and complex structures. These models are renowned for their exceptional performance on various image recognition tasks. 

**Reason for choosing :-** 
 Highest accuracy (90.1%) , less depth (16) , inference speed less when using GPU (CPU - 69.5 , GPU - 4.2)

### ResNet50
Employing transfer learning with the ResNet50 model enables us to exploit pre-trained weights, significantly reducing the training time required for image classification tasks. This approach is particularly advantageous when dealing with limited training data, as we can leverage the rich representations learned by the base model from a vast dataset like ImageNet.

**Reason for choosing :-** 
 Relatively lightweight (98 MB) , High Accuracy (92.1 % Top 5 accuracy), Moderate Parameters (25.6M) , Reasonable Inference Speed on GPU (CPU - 32.1, GPU - 4.7)
