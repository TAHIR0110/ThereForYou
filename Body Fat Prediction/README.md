## Motivation ðŸ’¡

Accurate measurement of body fat is inconvenient and costly. Thus, it's desirable to have easy methods of estimating body fat that are not inconvenient or costly. This dataset can be used to illustrate multiple regression techniques for predicting body fat percentage using easily measurable body circumference measurements.

## Dataset Details ðŸ“Š

The dataset includes the following variables:

- Density determined from underwater weighing
- Percent body fat from Siri's equation
- Age (years)
- Weight (lbs)
- Height (inches)
- Various body circumference measurements: Neck, Chest, Abdomen 2, Hip, Thigh, Knee, Ankle, Biceps, Forearm, and Wrist

These measurements follow specific standards outlined in Behnke and Wilmore (1974).

## Educational Use ðŸ“š

This dataset is ideal for educational purposes, particularly for illustrating multiple regression techniques in data analysis and machine learning. By utilizing the provided features, one can develop predictive models to estimate body fat percentage using simple measurement techniques.
