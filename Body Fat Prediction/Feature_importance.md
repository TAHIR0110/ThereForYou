# Feature Importance Analysis using Chi-squared, and ANOVA

## Introduction
In this analysis, we explore the importance of features in predicting body density. We use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to understand the variance explained by the features and Chi-squared and ANOVA tests to rank the features based on their importance contribution towards the label.

## Feature Importance Ranking
We utilized Chi-squared and ANOVA tests to rank the features based on their importance contribution towards predicting body density.

### Chi-squared Test
- The Chi-squared test is used to determine whether there is a significant association between categorical variables.
-  Target variable, 'Density', appears to be continuous, the Chi-squared test might not be applicable to it directly. However, if we discretize the target variable into bins or categories, we can use the Chi-squared test to analyze its relationship with other categorical features in our dataset.


### ANOVA Test
- ANOVA is used to compare the means of three or more groups to determine if they are significantly different from each other. It assesses whether there are statistically significant differences among group means.
- ANOVA can be applied to assess whether there are significant differences in the means of our continuous features ('Weight', 'Age', 'Height', etc.) across different categories of our target variable, 'Density'.

## Conclusion
- the Chi-squared test is suitable for analyzing relationships between categorical variables, while ANOVA is suitable for comparing means across different groups, especially when dealing with continuous and categorical variables. 
- we can conclude that 'BodyFat', 'Weight', and 'Abdomen' are the most important features for predicting body density, followed by 'Age', 'Chest', 'Hip', 'Thigh', 'Biceps', 'Knee', 'Neck', and 'Forearm'. 'Ankle', 'Height', and 'Wrist' show weaker associations with the target variable and may have less predictive power in this context
