# Genetic Disorder Detection
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect genetic disorders. Various classifiers are trained and evaluated to determine the most accurate model.
## Installation

To run the project, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using pip: pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn

## Description 

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of genetic disorders and evaluating the performance of various machine learning models to predict genetic disorders and their subclasses. The key steps involved are:

## Data Loading: 
a. Load the training and test datasets. 
b.Data Preprocessing: Clean the data by handling missing values, dropping irrelevant columns, and encoding categorical variables. 
c.Data Visualization: Create visualizations to understand the distribution and relationships of different features in the dataset. 
d.Model Evaluation: Use cross-validation to evaluate the performance of different machine learning models including Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors. 
e.Model Training: Train the models on the dataset and evaluate their accuracy. 
f.Prediction: Use the best-performing model to make predictions on the test dataset.
