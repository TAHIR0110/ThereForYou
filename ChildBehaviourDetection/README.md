# Child Behaviour Detection using Classification Algorithm

## Overview

This project aims to develop a system for detecting child behavior using classification algorithms. The system analyzes various data inputs, such as text analysis, activity logs, and other relevant behavioral patterns, to classify different types of behaviors. The objective is to provide insights into child behavior for applications in education, healthcare, and parental monitoring.

## Introduction

The child behavior detection system leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to analyze input data and classify behaviors. This project encompasses data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Features

- Collects and preprocesses data from various sources.
- Extracts features relevant to child behavior.
- Trains ML models using labeled datasets.
- Evaluates model performance and accuracy.
- Provides a predictive system for classifying child behavior.

## Data Collection

The system collects data from multiple sources such as text documents, activity logs, and user behavior. Ensure data privacy and compliance with data protection regulations during collection.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing includes cleaning, normalizing, and structuring the data. Techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming/lemmatization are applied for text data.

## Model Training

Machine learning algorithms such as decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks are employed. The system is trained using labeled datasets where child behaviors have been previously identified.

## Evaluation

The trained model is validated and tested using various metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability. Continuous refinement and retraining are performed to maintain system performance.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/child-behaviour-detection.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd child-behaviour-detection
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset and place it in the `data` directory.
2. Run the preprocessing script to clean and structure the data:
    ```sh
    python preprocess.py
    ```

3. Train the model using the training script:
    ```sh
    python train.py
    ```

4. Evaluate the model using the evaluation script:
    ```sh
    python evaluate.py
    ```

5. Use the prediction script to classify child behavior from new data:
    ```sh
    python predict.py --input new_data.txt
    ```
