# Deep Learning CNN Model To Predict Various Tomato Disease Using Leaf Images



## The Model is Trained Using The Tomato Leaf Image Dataset.

## Different Kind of Diseases The Model can Predict!

- Bacterial spot
- Early blight
- Late blight
- Leaf Mold.png
- Septoria leaf spot
- Spider mites Two spotted spider mite
- Target Spot
- Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus

### The Model can also Identify a Healthy Tomato Leaf.

## Some Sample Images

- Image Shape After Preprocesing: (50, 50, 3)
