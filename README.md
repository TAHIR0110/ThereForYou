# Enhanced Public Safety: ThereForYou
**ThereForYou** is a groundbreaking solution aimed at enhancing public safety, particularly focusing on mental health support and suicide prevention. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and blockchain, our project offers accessible and empathetic assistance to individuals facing mental health challenges.

## Key Features
### Part 1: AI Psychologist
- Dynamic Voice Adjustment: Our AI assistant dynamically adjusts its voice to match the user's gender, enhancing engagement and personalization.
- Emotion Detection: Utilizing algorithms, the assistant detects signs of sadness or depression in user speech, securely storing this data using blockchain technology for potential future counseling sessions.
- Empathetic Support: In moments of distress, sadness, or depression, the AI psychologist offers empathetic support and practical advice to encourage users towards positive steps forward.

### Part 2: Suicide Prevention Model
- Choking Detection: We have developed an API powered by advanced machine learning models that can detect signs of choking in users. Upon detection, it immediately sends alerts with location data of the victim to nearby users and authorities, including police officers, ensuring prompt assistance in critical situations.
- Reward System: Users who assist individuals in choking incidents are rewarded with HealthTokens, redeemable at hospitals. This incentivizes community involvement in assisting those in need.

### Part 3: Voice-Activated Safety Alert System
- NLP-Based Danger Detection: Our advanced NLP model detects danger signals from user speech. Upon detection, nearby users and authorities such as police officers are alerted through push notifications about the location and condition of the victim.
- Reward Mechanism: Similar to Part 2, individuals who respond to safety alerts and assist those in danger are rewarded with HealthTokens.
