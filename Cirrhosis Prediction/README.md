# Cirrhosis Dataset 🩺💊

Welcome to the Cirrhosis Dataset! 🎉 This dataset contains information collected from the Mayo Clinic trial in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver, conducted between 1974 and 1984. Cirrhosis is a late stage of scarring of the liver caused by various liver diseases and conditions, such as hepatitis and chronic alcoholism.

## Context 📋

The dataset includes data from 424 PBC patients referred to the Mayo Clinic during a ten-year interval. These patients met the eligibility criteria for a randomized placebo-controlled trial of the drug D-penicillamine. The dataset consists of patients who participated in the trial and those who did not but consented to have basic measurements recorded and to be followed for survival.

## Attribute Information 📝

4. **Drug**: Type of drug administered (D-penicillamine or placebo).
5. **Age**: Age of the patient in days.
