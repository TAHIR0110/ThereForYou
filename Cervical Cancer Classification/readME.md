# Cervical Cancer Classification

## Overview
This project aims to classify cervical cancer risk using machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains various features related to patients' demographics and medical records. We implemented and evaluated two models: Logistic Regression and Support Vector Classifier (SVC). Both models performed equally well, achieving an accuracy score of 99.4%.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on kaggle and contains features related to cervical cancer risk factors. 

## Models and Evaluation
We implemented two machine learning models:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

Both models were trained and evaluated on the dataset, and their performance was measured using accuracy score, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
Both the Logistic Regression and Support Vector Classifier models achieved an accuracy score of 99.4%. This indicates that both models are highly effective in classifying cervical cancer risk based on the provided features.
