## Introduction
According to the article "When college students post about depression on Facebook" by Jeff Grabmeier

"When college students post about feelings of depression on Facebook, their friends are unlikely to encourage them to seek help, a small study suggests. In fact, in this study, none of the 33 participating students said their friends told them they should reach out to a mental health professional to discuss their problems. Instead, most friends simply sent supportive or motivating messages. But that may not be good enough for people who are truly depressed – as some of the people in this study probably were, said Scottye Cash, lead author of the study and professor of social work at The Ohio State University.

“It makes me concerned that none of the Facebook friends of students in this study were proactive in helping their friend get help,” Cash said."

It may means that one of the important things is that how we can find depressed post by students and how we can support them because sometimes it is difficult for them to be helpd by their friend only via SNS...

In this notebook, I tried to model students anxiety and depression classify model. For modeling, I also refered "Spam Classifier | NLP | 98% Accuracy " by ANUBHAV GOYAL (https://www.kaggle.com/code/anubhavgoyal10/spam-classifier-nlp-98-accuracy).
