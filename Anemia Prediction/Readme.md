## ðŸ§¾ Description

In this project, the model is trained on the dataset containing information about 104 individuals, specifically aimed at predicting anemia based on image pixel values and hemoglobin levels . Decision Tree Classifier , Gradient Boosting Classifier have performed well ont the unseen data with accuracy 90% .

## ðŸ§® Changes made

1. Downloading Dataset : I have downloaded the dataset using Kaggle API.
2. Importing necessary libraries
3. Summary Statistics: In this section, I have created the summary of the data,EDA.
4. Splitting Training and Testing data: Splitting training and testing data helps to predict the models performance.
5. Model Training: Training the model using `Logistic Regression` , `Decision Tree Classifier` , `Gradient Boosting Classifier`
6. Testing : Testing the model on random data

## ðŸ“¢ Conclusion

Decision Tree Classifier , Gradient Boosting Classifier have performed well ont the unseen data with accuracy 90% .
